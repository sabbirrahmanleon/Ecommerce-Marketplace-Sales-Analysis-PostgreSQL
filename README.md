# Ecommerce-Marketplace-Sales-Analysis-PostgreSQL
In this project, I dove into an ecommerce marketplace sales dataset to uncover meaningful business insights using advanced SQL techniques.

üîç Key Highlights:

Identified top-selling and highest-rated products by category

Analyzed city-wise discounts and stock status

Created a comprehensive product overview view and an automated daily summary procedure

Leveraged SQL functions like CTE, Window Functions, Views, and Stored Procedures to drive insights

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

PostgreSQL

DBeaver

This project not only improved my query optimization and data summarization skills but also gave me practical experience with ecommerce KPIs and automation in SQL.
